This is a work in progress.  It is a css generator for using a single sprite sheet for multiple background images to reduce http requests.  

You can also load a css file created with Sprite Map Generator. There is also the ability to specify retina images that are double the resolution to create css where they are sized at 1/2 the size of the image.


So what do I do?
1)load an image.
2)add sprite slices
	a)press 'D' to add a sprite frame.
	b)drag the upper left corner to move the frame.
	c)drag the lower right corner to resize the frame.
	d)click the upper right corner to delete the frame.
	e)selecting a frame allows you to type a new class name in the tool panel, press enter to confirm.
3)after creating your sprite slices save out your CSS file. 


KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS:

=		: create sprite frame
-		: delete sprite frame
;		: toggle snapping
-hold space and drag to pan around image
